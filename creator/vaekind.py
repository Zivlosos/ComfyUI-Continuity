"""Which VAE is this file — and is it the one the family decodes with?

Every family in this pack decodes through exactly one VAE, and the picker
lists every file in `models/vae`, so the Flux 2 VAE sits one row from the Qwen
image VAE and nothing about either filename says which model it belongs to.
Pick the wrong one and the render samples the whole clip before core's decode
raises `The size of tensor a (16) must match the size of tensor b (128)` —
issue #94, from a user who could not have known which of the two rows was
theirs. The sentence they should have read is "this file is the Flux 2 VAE,
and Krea 2 decodes with the Qwen image VAE", and it should have come before
sampling rather than after.

The identification is core's own. `comfy/sd.py` picks a VAE's architecture off
which tensor names are in its state dict, and each `KINDS` entry here is that
same test read off the safetensors header — so a file this module calls the
Flux 2 VAE is a file core will load as one. Nothing here opens a tensor: the
header is a JSON blob at the front of the file (`visionweights.safetensors_header`),
and shapes are in it, which is how a 4-channel SD VAE and a 16-channel Flux 1
VAE are told apart when both are spelled `decoder.conv_in.weight`.

The answer is `None` for a file the table does not know — an unreadable
container, a VAE no family here loads — and `None` is *not* a refusal, for the
reason `visionweights` gives: the loader downstream gets to complain about a
file we could not read, and grounding a render over a header this table has
not learned would be a worse bug than the one it fixes. Only a file this module
positively recognises as the wrong one is refused.

`tests/test_vaekind.py` builds the headers and runs this standalone.
