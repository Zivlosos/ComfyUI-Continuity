"""The RefMod routes: make one, and handle the file it is.

`/continuity/refmod/make` is a job (`creator/jobs.py`): encoding through the
H3 VAE is GPU work and goes on the queue behind whatever is rendering, with
Cancel and the real progress bar. The result is the picker rows of what was
written, so the caller can attach them without a second listing. Two shapes
of result: one mod per picture (`compressed` / `full`), or — `stack` — every
still and clip handed in as one `video`-kind file, which is what the sibling
pack means by a character (see `refmod.stack`).

The rest are the file itself, and none of them touch a tensor: `file` hands
the .safetensors out, `upload` takes one in, `move` renames it, `delete`
removes it, `describe` rewrites the one header field worth editing. They exist
because a RefMod is a character somebody carries between machines and packs —
the sibling pack's README ships one as a download — and a folder you can only
reach over ssh is not a library.

The listing needs no route of its own: `/continuity/assets?root=refmods` lists
mods and `/continuity/thumb` serves their pictures (`server_routes`).
