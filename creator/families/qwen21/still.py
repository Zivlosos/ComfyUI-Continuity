"""Qwen Image 2.1's own half of an image render: the constants and the
sampler branch.

The shared flow — prompt, triggers, references, the /16 canvas — is
`compile_image.compile_prestage` and `render_image.emit`, which take this
module as the `family` and read the declarations below. What stays here is
what only this architecture knows: one encoder node that reads the sentence
and every attached picture together and hands back both conditionings, the
`<imageN>` spelling its tokenizer writes in front of each picture, the pixel
budget the references are resized to, and the fact that the first picture is
also the one being edited.

Everything it emits is core's, taken from the official ComfyUI Qwen Image 2.1
templates (`image_qwen_image_2_1_t2i`, `_image_edit`) rather than invented.
Compared with the Qwen Image Edit family this is a shorter graph, not a
variant of the same one: the schedule is detected (`supported_models.
QwenImage21` carries the shift, so no `ModelSamplingAuraFlow`), the templates
sample at cfg 1 with no `CFGNorm`, and drawing from nothing and editing a
picture go through the same encoder node — its template is the text-to-image
one with the references prepended, so there is no system prompt about a
picture that is not there and nothing to switch encoders over.

# Klein and unlike Qwen Image Edit, the official graph starts the latent
# *empty*: the picture reaches the model through the reference conditioning,
# and `emit_graph` honours that by emitting the template's own empty latent
# for a full-denoise init rather than an encode about to be noised away.
# Without the flag the pictures are references on the aspect pill's canvas —
# a character rendered once, then drawn into a sheet — and an explicit init
# wins over either.

# The references' pixel budget and the canvas, which are one decision here.
# `TextEncodeQwenImage21` resizes each picture to about `resolution`² pixels,
# aspect kept, on the vision tower's /32 patch grid, and hands back an empty
# latent at the *first* picture's resized size with the note that "any other
# size shifts the edit": the reference latent is spliced into the sequence at
# that size, and a target one latent row bigger or smaller is an edit that
# drifts. So on an edit the canvas is not snapped to the shared /16 grid and
# the budget derived from it — that is off by a row on a 4:3 phone photo at
# the default edge — but built the other way round: the budget is taken from
# the canvas the shared compile resolved, and the canvas becomes the encoder's
# own resize of the picture at that budget, by the encoder's own arithmetic.
# The budget then rides in the payload (`ref_resolution`), because a /32
# canvas does not round back to the budget that made it on a wide aspect. The
# template's fixed 1024 is not kept: a 2K edit wants a 2K reference. 0 would
# keep every reference at its file size, which on a phone photo is a
