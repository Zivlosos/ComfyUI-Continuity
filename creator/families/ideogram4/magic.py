"""Ideogram 4.0's magic prompt: prose in, the JSON caption the model reads out.

Ideogram's weights were trained on structured captions and nothing else, and
their authors say what a plain line does: it "will not work and will likely
trigger a safety warning". `still.format_prompt` keeps a plain line off the
model by wrapping it into the smallest caption the schema allows — the same
sentence as the summary, the background and the one element — which renders,
but hands the model none of the structure it was trained to read. What fills
the structure in is a language model reading Ideogram's own instruction for
the job, which Ideogram publishes as the *magic prompt*
(`magic_prompt/v1.txt`, vendored byte for byte by
`tools/vendor_ideogram_magic.py`; Apache-2.0, licence beside it).

**A second pass, never a fatter first one.** The chat's turn is one small
decision in a fixed reply contract, and this is a 28 KB rule sheet whose answer
is a nested object — the two things `chat.py` keeps out of a turn on purpose.
So the turn writes prose as it always has, the cast is expanded into words the
way the render would expand it, and only then is the prose handed to this
instruction, alone, the way Ideogram's own pipeline hands it a user's idea.
The caption rides on the action, so the render never calls a model and a
retake on a new seed is the same caption.

**What is Ideogram's and what is the pack's.** The instruction and the key
order are Ideogram's: the upstream client reorders every caption into the
order `CaptionVerifier` enforces, drops the `aspect_ratio` the instruction asks
for first (it steers the bboxes, and the model never reads it), and by default
drops the bboxes too. All three are ported here (`canonical`), because this
pack's backends are not upstream's client. What is the pack's are the two
promises a prompt box makes everywhere else — quoted words survive letter for
letter, and a `{a|b}` group stays a choice for the seed — which the upstream
instruction does not know about and which are said in the user turn
(`user_message`) and checked on the answer (`caption`), never by editing the
vendored file.

No ComfyUI, no torch: the request and the reply are ordinary data.
