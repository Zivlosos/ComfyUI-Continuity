"""Ideogram 4.0's own half of an image render: the preset table and the
dual-model sampler branch.

The shared flow is `compile_image.compile_prestage` and `render_image.emit`,
which take this module as the `family`. What stays here is what only Ideogram
knows: its knobs are the official preset table rather than a steps widget
alone (mu and std shape the resolution-shifted schedule, so they belong to the
preset, not to the user), its unconditional branch is a separate checkpoint
behind `DualModelGuider`, and its schedule is `Ideogram4Scheduler`'s — which is
why this branch samples through `SamplerCustomAdvanced` rather than `KSampler`.

The sampler row is the other thing only Ideogram knows, and none of it is the
template's: the conditional branch runs behind `ModelSamplingAuraFlow` at shift
5 with res_2m, and the guidance tail starts at a fixed percent — see the
constants below for what the stock row did instead.

Two more things are Ideogram's alone. Its prompt is a JSON caption, not prose
(`format_prompt`), and a LoRA over it is two patches — one per checkpoint, each
at its own weight (`emit_graph`).
