"""A shot says what it is made of, whether the file is its own or the piece's (#91).

Two separate failures wore one face here, and both of them needed a strip of
more than one card to appear at all.

The first is the row. A piece of one shot keeps the cast's pictures on that
shot; growing a second card moves them into the pool (`promoteCastFiles`),
because card 2 cannot see card 1's row. The editor's reference row read
`state.assets` and nothing else, so from the moment the strip grew it had
nothing left to draw: casting somebody emptied the one place that answers "what
is this shot made of", on every card at once, with no error anywhere near it.
The reference was still bound the whole time — which is what made it look like
a dead div rather than a lost file.

The second is not cosmetic. `motion` became a *list* of clips, and the two
places that rename a member's handles as their files move carried on reading it
as a single handle — so the clip went into the pool under `ref-N` and the
member went on naming the `vid-N` that nothing holds. Their action rode into no
shot at all. `inheritTakes` read the same slot the same way and stopped
narrowing an action clip for the same reason.
