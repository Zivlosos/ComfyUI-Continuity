"""The two shapes the chat room and the chat server agree about in silence.

    python3 tests/test_chat_mirror.py

Everything else between the room and `creator/chat.py` fails loudly: a bad
action is a sentence naming the field, a blob the compiler will not take is a
refusal in a bubble. Two things do not.

**A handle's prefix is how the server knows what a file is.** `chat._media_kind`
reads `img-3` as a picture and `vid-1` as a clip — there is no `kind` beside it
in the action, and there cannot be, because the model writes the handle and
nothing else. So a room that minted `pic-3` would send a citation the compiler
refuses with a sentence about a handle nobody recognises, for a file that is
sitting right there.

**A ledger entry is read field by field.** `ledger_line` draws the line the
model reads and `_cited` opens the file behind it; a room that wrote `file`
where the server reads `filename` would produce a ledger that looks right on
screen, reads as a row of bare handles to the model, and refuses every citation
as a thing with no file behind it.

Both are one word each, in two languages, and neither has a test that would go
red. This is that test. It reads the source rather than running it, the way
`test_js_links.py` does: what is being held together is two spellings, and
spelling is visible in the text.
