"""The chat surface's contract: what the model may answer, and what it becomes.

    python tests/test_chat.py

Runs standalone — no torch, no ComfyUI, no network, no model. Everything under
test is `creator/chat.py`, which is pure for exactly this reason: the whole
protocol between a small local model and this pack's compiler is ordinary data,
and the failures it has to survive are the ones nobody can reproduce on demand.

Four things are pinned here, and each of them is a decision the spec argues for
rather than an implementation detail.

**The parse forgives transport and the validation forgives nothing.** A 4B model
leaks a `<think>` block, fences its object, writes a sentence in front of it, or
drops the fence entirely — none of those is a disagreement about the contract,
so all four have to come back as the same action. What the object *holds* is the
opposite: every refusal is a sentence naming the field, because that sentence is
quoted straight back to the model on the one re-ask and shown to a person if the
second attempt fails too.

**The protocol is two calls, never three.** A reply that will not validate earns
one re-ask; a `say` in answer to "make me a picture" earns one re-ask; a second
failure is the model's own prose in a bubble. A third round trip would be a room
that hangs on a model having a bad day.

**The card is the join nothing else makes.** Manifests, the files on disk and
this machine's picks each answer a third of "can I render this now", and a
family with a required file missing has to say so in the card so the model can
say so instead of trying.

**The blob patch is the only resolution there is.** `from` becomes references in
the order cited, a still cited by a clip is that clip's first frame, and a
handle the ledger has never heard of is refused before anything reaches the
compiler.
