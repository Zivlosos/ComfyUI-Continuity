"""Ideogram 4.0's magic prompt: the request, the caption, and where it goes.

    python tests/test_ideogram_magic.py

Pure: no model, no ComfyUI. What is pinned is everything around the one
generation — that the vendored instruction is the one sent and the user turn is
upstream's own, that a reply becomes a caption in the model's key order with
the aspect and (by default) the boxes gone, that the two promises a prompt box
makes (quoted words, `{a|b}` groups) are held against the answer, that a caption
survives the seed's choosing, and that the chat renders the caption while
keeping the prose.
