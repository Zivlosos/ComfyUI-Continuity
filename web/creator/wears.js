// What each family gets when it renders a cast member.
//
// A member is universal — a name, a description, the files they are made of
// — and everything derived from those is one family's: a saved reference is a
// latent in one VAE's space, a LoRA is weights for one architecture, and
// whether a family should be handed their pictures at all is a question with
// a different answer on Ideogram (which reads none) and on Krea 2 (which reads
// them through an adapter). The first version of this card had a ledger that
// counted for the piece's family, a submenu that offered the others, and a
// "wears" line that named no family at all — so a member on an H3 piece could
// not say what a Klein still should get, and could not be saved for Klein at
// all once their H3 mods existed.
//
// So the derived half of a member is drawn *per family*: one tab a family,
// and under the open tab one sentence saying what that family is handed —
// "When Flux 2 Klein renders @anna it gets their 2 pictures wearing
// anna_klein" — where every noun in the sentence is the control. The status
// line under it is the one fact about that family that changes what to do:
// save once for the token win, hang the adapter, or nothing to set up.
//
// One panel, two hosts. The shelf (a card on a node, or in the Timeline
// window) and the library sheet draw the same tabs; what differs is where a
// member's files live and where an encode lands, which the host supplies as
// callbacks. The panel itself owns only which tab is open, and writes `send`
// straight onto the member (`state.wearOn`).
