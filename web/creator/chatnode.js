// What the room takes from the canvas, and whose each setting is.
//
// A chat renders from its own piece. Its family, its shape, its seed, its
// cast, the files it made and attached, and the family's pinned LoRAs are all
// the conversation's, assembled by `chat.js` at render time; nothing on the
// canvas is read into a chat render and nothing a chat renders is written
// onto the canvas. The one exception is how a render *samples* — the sampler
// row and the turbo switch — and that only while the room follows the node:
// a chat is usually opened over a piece somebody has already tuned, and the
// steps, the guidance and the schedule they settled on are the ones a draft
// beside it should sample on too. So a machine set up once, on the node, is
// set up for its chats.
//
// **Every row says whose it is.** `source(kind)` answers one of three words,
// and the *Makes with* sheet wears the answer as a badge beside the row:
//
//   - `node` — the node under the room is on this family, and its row is
//     what the room samples on. Change the node and the room changes.
//   - `chat` — the room keeps a row of its own for this side, kept on the
//     machine (`settings.chat`) so it is there on the next page and for every
//     chat. The node is free to be set differently.
//   - `defaults` — there is nothing to follow: no node under the room, or a
//     node on another family (H3's steps are not LTX's, and H3's turbo LoRA
//     is not a file LTX can wear). The family's own defaults, all the way down.
//
// **A row of the chat's own is the steps and the guidance, never the
// speed-ups.** The accelerators — block cache, spectrum, attention, VDN, the
// low-VRAM and fast-math switches — are statements about this machine rather
// than about a piece, so they are never copied into the chat's row and never
// drawn on it; the render takes the node's where the node can be followed
// and the family's defaults where it cannot (`row`).
//
// The chat's own row is drawn with the same functions the faces mount —
// `samplingBar`, `turboPills`, `PreStageRow` — over a blank blob of the
// room's family through `blobIO`. A followed row is read, never drawn: the
// node is the one place it is edited, which is the whole point of following.
