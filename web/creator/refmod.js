// Saving somebody as a saved reference: the ledger, and the job behind it.
//
// A RefMod is the DiT half of a reference already encoded — one H3 VAE latent
// in a safetensors file, the format `ComfyUI-MiniMaxH3Mod` reads and writes
// (`creator/refmod.py` says the rest). What it is *for* here is a cast member:
// their looks come from a few pictures, and each picture is a few hundred
// reference tokens riding through every sampling step. Saved as compressed mods
// they are sixty-four each, and a shot that could carry two of them can carry
// six. Saved as full mods they are the same encode cached on disk, shareable as
// one file per picture.
//
// So the door is the *ledger*, a line under the member's tiles that says what
// their looks cost a render and offers to save them: encode every picture they
// are built out of and hang the mod on the picture. The picture stays — it is
// the reference every family can read, and what a still family is handed —
// and it carries its renditions by latent space (`asset.mods`): the family
// rendering it takes the one in its own space and encodes the picture
// otherwise. A stack is the exception: one video file standing for every
// still and clip, the sibling pack's own shape for a character, and it takes
// the pictures' place the way it always did. The first version of this was a
// cube icon in the card's header, which said none of that; the number is the
// argument, so the number is what is drawn.
//
// A latent belongs to one VAE, so "a mod" is a mod *for a family*: H3's, or
// Flux 2 Klein's, made from the same picture through that family's VAE. The
// ledger is drawn for the piece's own family and the menu offers the others
// this machine could encode for (`modFamilies`), so a member on an H3 piece
// can carry a Klein rendition for the chat's stills.
//
// The host does the attaching, for the reason the shelf's `keep` and `library`
// are the host's: a shelf does not know whether a member's pictures live on a
// card's row or in the piece's pool, and there are two hosts.
